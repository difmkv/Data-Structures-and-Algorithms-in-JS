/**
 * COUNT SORT
 *
 * Can be done in O(k+n) because it does not compare values.
 * It works only for numbers and given a certain range.
 * Instead of sorting by swapping elements, this count
 * works by counting occurrences of each element in the array.
 * Once occurrences of each element are counted, the new array
 * can be created using those occurrences. This sorts the data
 * without having to swap elements.
 *
 * Use count sort when youâ€™re sorting integers with a limited range.
 * This will be the fastest sort for this case.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(k+n)
 * Space Complexity: O(k)
